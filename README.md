## What's Chowin-Out?

**Chowin-Out is your best friend to find food**

- Users can  **discover new food around** and find a restaurant information that serves that food.
- In addition, they can **find food based on a photo** (like Shazam, powered by Machine Learning) and **get the recipe** for that food and cook it yourself. 
- They can also **save food** on their favorite list and **share** restaurant info or food recipe with their friends and family

## Functionality
- Chowin-Out is a fully functioning food discovery app
- Users can get food local food based on location
- Users can find food recipes based on a photo
- Users can like and save foods
- Users can share information with their friends and family


Would like to implement dynamic seasonal tab to offer users to find food based on seasonal vegetables and fruits, and overall make the app more UI friendly and functional.
